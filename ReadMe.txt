Basic Information Regarding the project.

We are trying to create a portal. A portal which interacts with the various elements of the website.

Tasks completed
	0. I have made proper notes for the scope of the project.
		Important Realisation
		a. One, Don't change the things are already good.
		b. Improvisation was/is needed for a few pages only.
			i. Administration home page was redundant in many aspects, so I have improvised there (This is done)
			ii. Time-table, especially the examination time-table (This is planned) (Go for PDF!!)
	1. I made the home page and made it device responsive
		a. Issues missed.
			i. The device responsiveness fails below 1360px and above the 991px.
			Reason: calc(100% - 1360px). Need to do something about it
	2. I made the administration page.
		a. I am not supposed to populate the pages. I made a sample page.
		b. The image gallery for the administration is for represenation purposes only. I need to make it more realistic. Like ID card.
	3. I made the profile page for one professor.
		a. Even this is a smaple page. We are not bothered in what and how many the professors are and what they do.
	4. Generalised classes for various components on the pages have been made. (I need to strategize on how to improve it.)
    5. All the basic layouts of the pages in the hotlinks have been made.
        a. Hoving done this. I know that this doesn't take as much time as it seems.
        b. The basic layout is nothing to do with brute force. We can optimize.
        c. It took me 6-7 hours of code writing to make this much progress.
        d. Apart from this. 

Tasks left.
	1. Find the solution for the tables and try porting it to the mobile devices. (Most difficult task among these all)
	2. Drop down menu for the websites need to be made and the full overlay menu bar. (This is the only way to remove accidental touches on the lower layers)
	3. JS based animations for the all the key interactive elements. (This is the craziest part of all)

	4. After making all the webpages, I have to realise that the task division is technically not possible. 
	It simply ain't. And showing the final result will actually disappoint the team member. IDC.

	5. Interlinking of the webpages is really important. (Haven't done this part yet)
	6. Team members are not for populating the webpages.
	7. I need to figure out a way of archiving stuff too. And all the interactive stuff through the input fields.
	8. Making more than one elements of the static website is a mere waste of time. It is just for the proposal purposes. I need to sort this issue out by tomorrow night.

Update 18.03.20
	1. Issue for tables sorted. Forever. 80% task of the entire static frontend is done. Period.
	2. JS animations with the progress of time.
	3.
